'''Given two sorted arrays, find the median element amongst the two arrays.
That is, if both arrays were combined, find the median element from the
combined array. Assume that there is not enough memory to actually combine
both arrays. There exists an O(log n + log m) solution.
Solution
Since they are sorted, you can find the middle element of each to find the
medians of each list. The actual median is now somewhere in between these
two numbers. You can then discard the non-relevant portions of each list.
Repeat the process. When the middle elements from both lists converge,
you have now found the median element.

To make two halves, make the partition such that the index that partitioning
array A[] + the index that partitioning array B[] are equal to the total
number of elements plus one divided by 2, i.e. (n + m + 1) / 2 (+1 is, if
the total number of elements is odd).

First, define two variables : min_index and max_index, and initialize
min_index to 0, and max_index to the length of the smaller array.
In these below examples A[] is the smaller array.
To partition A[], use the formula (min_index + max_index) / 2 and insert
it to a variable i. To partition B[], use the formula (n + m + 1) / 2 â€“ i
and insert it to a variable j. the variable i means the number of elements
to be inserted from A[] into the first half, and j means the number of
elements to be inserted from B[] into the first half, the rest of the
elements will be inserted into the second half.
