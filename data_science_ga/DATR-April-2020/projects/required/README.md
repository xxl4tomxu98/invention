## Project Structure

This course will ask you to complete a series of projects in order to practice and apply the skills covered in-class.

### Unit Projects
At the end of each Unit, you'll work on short structured projects. These activities will test your understanding of that unit’s most important concepts with in-class practice and instructor support. 

For those of you who want to go above and beyond, we’ve also included stretch options, bonus activities, and other opportunities for further reading and practice.


### Final Project
In our [final project](./project-final/), we'll ask you to apply your skills to a real-world or business problem of your choice.

This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your new skills and tackle a pressing issue relevant to your life, industry, or organization. You’ll create a hypothesis, analyze internal data, and generate a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

You will get structured guidance and designated time to work throughout the course. Final project deliverables include:

- **Proposal**: Describe your chosen problem and identify relevant data sets (confirming access, as needed).
- **Brief**:  Share a summary of your initial analysis and your next steps with your instructional team.
- **Report**: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (or other files) documenting your code and process for technical/peer stakeholders.
- **Presentation**: Present a summary of your business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.

## Rubric

For all deliverables, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Instructors will also provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.
