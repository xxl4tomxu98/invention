### Flex Topics

Flex sessions are designed to provide your class with time to catch up, review materials, ask questions, work on projects, or go deeper into specific topic areas.

Later in the course, instructors may optionally choose to cover additional topics, depending on the needs of your course. Some examples include:

Title  |
