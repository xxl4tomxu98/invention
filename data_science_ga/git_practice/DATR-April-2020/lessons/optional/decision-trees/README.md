## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson | Part 1. Decision Trees | [Here](./decision-trees.ipynb) |
|        | Part 2. Ensembles & Random Forests | [Here](./ensembles-random-forests.ipynb)
| Datasets | MLB player data | [hitters.csv](./data/hitters.csv)
| | Titanic survivors | [titanic.csv](./data/titanic.csv)
| | Vehicles (test) | [vehicles_test.csv](./data/vehicles_test.csv)
|  | Vehicles (train) | [vehicles_train.csv](./data/vehicles_train.csv)
| Practice | Random Forest from Scratch | [Here](./practice)
| Source Materials | Original files used to create this lesson | [Here](./slides/) |

> The MLB player data and Titanic datasets were chosen for this lesson because they are small enough to make very interpretable decision trees without much tuning. The vehicle data is very small, chosen as an easy example students could do by hand. It also provides a pre-split test set.

## Learning Objectives 

This lesson has two parts. Decision trees are introduced in part one, while random forests and other ensemble methods are elaborated on in part two. If you have limited class time, focus specifically on part one.


### Part One: Decision Trees

After this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain how a decision tree is created.
- Build a decision tree model in scikit-learn.
- Tune a decision tree model and explain how tuning impacts the model.
- Interpret a tree diagram.
- Describe the key differences between regression and classification trees.
- Decide whether or not a decision tree is an appropriate model for a given problem.



### Part Two: Ensembles & Random Forests

After this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define how and why decision trees can be improved using bagging and random forests.
- Build random forest models for classification and regression.
- Explain how to extract the most important predictors in a random forest model.

---

## Student Requirements
Before this lesson, students should already be able to:
- Build and evaluate classification models in sklearn
- Explain how and when to apply different resampling methods
- Define the concepts of cross-validation and overfitting

*If you're looking for additional references, we recommend the following books:*
- __CHAPTER 8__ - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) - This book provides a fantastic introduction to machine learning models and the statistics behind them. The visuals and explanations are really easy to understand. PDF available to download on the website.
- __CHAPTER 9__ - [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - This book is by most of the same authors as the previous book, but goes into more detail. PDF available to download on the website.
- __CHAPTER 8__ - [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485) - While this book features R code, the discussion of different predictive models and sampling methodologies are hard to beat.
