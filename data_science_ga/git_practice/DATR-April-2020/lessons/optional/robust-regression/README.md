## Materials We Provide
<!--- This section is a table of contents for the activity. The table structure breaks down repo resources into types, distinguishing between notebooks and supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials. Most lessons won't require all of these categories. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson | Robust Regression Lesson | [Link](./robust-regression.ipynb)|
| Activity | Robust Regression Activity | [Link](./baltimore-salaries-lab.ipynb)|
| Data Set | Lemonade Data Used in Lesson | [Link](./data/lemonade-stand.csv)|
| Data Set | Baltimore City Employee Salaries Used in Activity | [Link](./data/Baltimore_City_Employee_Salaries_2011.csv)|


> **Data description**: `lemonade-stand.csv` is a data set of lemonade sales and their relationship to temperature and humidity. The Baltimore City Employee Salaries data is pretty self-explanatory.

> **Note:** This lesson involves some hands-on physical activities. You might want to check whether there is a large open
> space available. As an optional extension, we recommend bringing in a ball of string and a large number of numbered counters; this type of interactive visual activity can make for a more enjoyable experience (and a faster one, too).

## Learning Objectives
<!--- This section lists the lesson's learning objectives. For information on how to write clear learning objectives, review [this resource](http://ii.library.jhu.edu/2016/07/20/writing-effective-learning-objectives/). --->

- **Review** the limitations and shortcomings of OLS and the $R^2$ scoring function.
- **Define** when to use robust regression methods instead of OLS.
- **Demonstrate** how Theil-Sen, RANSAC, and Huber work and what they are optimizing for.
- **Explain** the advantages of using median absolute error as a scoring function.
- **Create** a scoring function that's appropriate for different business scenarios.

## Student Requirements
<!--- This section explains the relevant prerequisites â€” in other words, what students need to know to be able to benefit from and perform the tasks required in this activity/lab. List all of the relevant skills or prior learning objectives here. --->

**Before this activity, students should already be able to**:
- Split a data set into training and testing parts.
- Create a linear model using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.
- Create a scatterplot using Matplotlib.
- Understand the concept of error in a prediction.
